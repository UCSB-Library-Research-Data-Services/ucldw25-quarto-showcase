Quarto is a publication a multi- scripting languages data analysis and visualization
platform, often used in conjunction with code notebooks. Quarto enables
a more reproducible approach to data-driven research by integrating
documentation, code, and results in one document. But it’s also a great
publication platform on its own! In this session a panel of Quarto users
will showcase what Quarto is capable of, especially when used in concert
with GitHub Pages hosting, including creating websites (course websites,
personal websites, blogs), presentations, dashboards, academic papers,
and books. We will also demonstrate, in real-time, how easy it is to
create such research deliverable.

Be prepared to be sold on using Quarto!
